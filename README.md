# NoteTakingApp
Ever felt like your handwritten notes for class are more of a chore to keep track of than being useful? This is problem many students face. Handwritten notes are a convenient way of writing down information during lectures, but organizing these notes is a whole other beast.

To address this, I have created an Android app that stores and accesses notes
* Store notes by taking pictures of your handwritten papers
* Whe it comes time to review your notes for a particular class, you can search the note images for keywords, allowing you to solely access the notes with those keywords

This Android app was developed in Java and uses other technologies such as Room Database and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services's Read API for OCR.
